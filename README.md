# Open-Source Ideas: Cloud-Native

This repository has been created in order to collect and maintain a list of ideas for cloud-native open-source projects.

## Purpose

We think there's a reason for creating such a list for two reasons:
1. Simply, there's many ideas around how to move the cloud-native topics forward.
2. We have been meeting people lately who were interested in starting an open-source project, but were not sure what to choose from.

Obviously, such a collection of ideas shall be an open-source repository itself too.

## Workflow

The envisioned workflow is the following:
1. A new idea is logged via a Pull-Request (PR). The scope of this repo is limited to cloud-native topics.
2. During a staging stage (2 weeks), it receives positive and negative votes.
3. If there's more positive votes in the end, the PR is merged. Otherwise it's declined.
4. The PR carries the necessary description of the idea, typically written in two blocks (1. problem, 2. solution).
5. If a project idea makes it to real-world, the link (or link, if there are more projects spawned) are added into this list accordingly.
6. If a time shows, that an idea, which has been added to a list some time ago is not relevant anymore, a PR is created to remove it. Again, 2 weeks of staging followed by the same evaluation principles apply.
7. Any suggestion to a workflow change happens as an update to this README document via a PR.
